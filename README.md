# Presence-Footsteps
An overly complicated footstep sound enhancement mod for Minecraft.

Originally authored by Hurricaaane, now updated past Minecraft 1.15.2 by Sollace.

This mod has been ported to support Architectury. 
It has all the original mod's features, with the exception being the config GUI, which may 
be added back at a later date.
